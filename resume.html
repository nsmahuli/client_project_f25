    <h2>Cover Letter FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Do I really need a cover letter?</strong><br>
        Yes—unless the employer specifically says not to submit one, a cover letter is a valuable opportunity to show your unique qualifications and interest. It gives context to your resume and demonstrates your communication skills.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How long should my cover letter be?</strong><br>
        Aim for one page, typically 3–4 concise paragraphs. Keep it under 400 words and ensure every sentence contributes something meaningful.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Should I use the same cover letter for every application?</strong><br>
        No. Always customize your cover letter to the specific job and organization. Highlight the qualifications that best match their needs and use the company’s name and details specific to that role.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Who should I address the cover letter to?</strong><br>
        Whenever possible, address it to a specific person (such as the hiring manager or team lead). If you can’t find a name, use “Dear Hiring Manager” or the role title (e.g., “Dear Data Analyst Search Committee”).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Can I repeat content from my resume?</strong><br>
        Avoid copying bullet points directly from your resume. Instead, use the cover letter to add depth—explain the impact, tell a story, or connect different experiences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Can I get someone to review my cover letter?</strong><br>
        Ye! UMSI CDO offers resume and cover letter reviews—submit your draft for feedback or book a one-on-one session for personalized guidance. You can <a href="https://umich.instructure.com/courses/137916/pages/talk-to-a-career-coach" target="_blank">meet with a CDO Career Coach</a> to review your materials.
