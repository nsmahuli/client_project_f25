    <h2>Turn Interviews into Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
      Every interview is more than a test—it’s a conversation and a gateway to exciting possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interviews allow you to show how your UMSI experiences set you apart, demonstrate your problem-solving skills, and convey your enthusiasm for the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter your comfort level, preparation is the best way to ensure you communicate your value and make a lasting impression.

    <h2>Interview Prep Checklist</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Get to Know the Employer</strong> Dig into the organization’s work, values, and recent projects. Familiarize yourself with their mission and think about how you can contribute.</li>
      <li><strong>Reread the Job Description</strong> Highlight skills and qualifications they’re looking for. Draft a few stories from your UMSI experience that illustrate those skills in action.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare Your Storytelling Toolkit</strong> Don’t just list responsibilities—explain your impact. Use frameworks like STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to paint a vivid picture of your accomplishments.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Different Interview Types</strong> Phone, virtual, and in-person interviews each have unique rhythms. Try simulating each format with a friend or career coach.</li>
      <li><strong>Ready Your Questions</strong> Thoughtful questions show you’re both engaged and evaluating the fit for yourself. Ask about team dynamics, challenges, or growth opportunities.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan Your Logistics</strong> Choose your outfit, test your technology, and map your route or set up your interview space.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Networking FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>What if my resume doesn’t match every qualification?</strong><br>
        Focus on what you offer—your ability to learn, adapt, and contribute. Interviews are your chance to highlight transferable skills and how quickly you pick up new concepts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What’s the best way to respond to “Tell me about a challenge you’ve faced”?</strong><br>
        Pick a story where you grew or made a difference, not just the biggest problem you’ve faced. End it with what you learned or how you’ll apply that lesson going forward.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How can I calm my nerves before and during the interview?</strong><br>
        Practice aloud, visualize a positive outcome, and remind yourself that the interviewer wants you to succeed. Take slow breaths, smile, and take pauses as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How soon should I follow up after an interview?</strong><br>
        Send a thank you note within 24 hours—mention specifics from your conversation and reiterate your enthusiasm.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How can I handle tough or unexpected questions?</strong><br>
        It’s perfectly okay to take a breath and think. If you don’t know an answer, be honest and explain how you’d go about finding a solution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What supports does UMSI offer for interviews?</strong><br>
        From one-on-one coaching and practice sessions to interview workshops and resource guides, the CDO is here to help you every step of the way.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
       You’ve worked hard to get to this stage—now let your skills and personality shine. Every interview is a learning opportunity. With solid preparation and a positive attitude, you’re ready for whatever comes next!
