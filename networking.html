    <h2>Networking FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>I feel awkward reaching out to people. How do I get started?</strong><br>
        Start with those you have something in common with—classmates, UMSI alumni, or friends of friends. Using a simple script can make initial outreach easier.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What should I include in my first message?</strong><br>
        Introduce yourself, reference a shared connection or interest, state your purpose for reaching out (such as learning about their career journey), and request a brief conversation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How do I make networking less transactional?</strong><br>
        Focus on learning and relationship building—not just asking for favors or jobs. Be curious, listen well, and offer your thanks and insights where you can.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What’s the best way to keep in touch?</strong><br>
        Follow up after conversations with a thank you, and periodically share updates on your progress, or send interesting articles or event invitations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Is virtual or in-person networking more valuable?</strong><br>
        Both are useful! Take advantage of campus events for in-person connections and use LinkedIn or email to expand your network globally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Can the CDO help me meet new people?</strong><br>
        Yes. The CDO team can recommend contacts, host networking events, and help you strategize your outreach.
      </li>
    </ul>
